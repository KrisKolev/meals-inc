Personal Plan (starting 6th November)

1. I know where the issue with the CI is. I know why it accurs and how to fix it.
But because the solution is kind of risky I do not want to break my application and submit something that does not work.(Done)

2. My next step is to improve the backend with POST func. and immediately after that configure the database.(Done)

3. Sonarqube (Done)

4. JWT

5. Unit tests.

6. Then I move on to the most important feature of the application (managing orders) and focusing on it
for as long as possible.
